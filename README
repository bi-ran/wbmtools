A collection of python scripts to parse information from CMS web based
monitoring. Anything available in wbm can in theory be parsed.

This uses kerberos-based authenication, therefore you must have a kerberos
ticket active. Additionally you will the cern certificate CA bundle to allow
the WBM certificate to be validated. This is most easily obtained from lxplus,
lxplus.cern.ch:/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt

The external requirements can easily be installed with pip in a virtualenv

      python3 -m venv <dir>
      source <dir>/bin/activate
      pip install -r requirements.txt

To complete the environment setup

      kinit <user>@CERN.CH
      export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.
      export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=ca-bundle.crt

When you are done, type "deactivate" to return to your normal python env
